# Roadmap
1- setting up the project environment:
   *  initialize npm to create project info
   * Use npm to install express, body-parser, and cors 

2- working on the server side `server.js` file:
   * the `project Data` object is already added
   * require and use the installed packages 
   * create a local server running on port 3000
   * adding a GET route which returns the `projectData` object in the server code 
   * adding POST route which adds incoming data of 
     temperature, date, and user response to the `projectData`

3- working on the `website/app.js` file:
   * setting the global variables which get the data stored or which will store in the DOM
     elements
   * correction the date expression
   * defining the external URL of the OpenWeatherMap website
   * create my API key of the OpenWeatherMap website
   * use async function and fetch to make a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API.
   * use async function to make the POST request.
   * finally, updating the UI to reflect the dynamic values of temperature
     , date, and user input

4- modifying the `style.css` file for App customization and perfection
